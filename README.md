Collection of scripts to extract different semantic entities such as named-entities and SRL

You need to install AllenNLP like this:

`mamba install -c conda-forge allennlp-all`

Note, do not use `conda` because ,at least for me, conda hangs indefinietely trying to install it.

You also need `spacy`, `flair`, and `datasets` from HuggingFace.
